📸 Discord Image Logger
The Discord Image Logger project aims to develop a system that can log and store images shared within the Discord messaging platform. Discord is a popular communication platform primarily used by gamers and online communities to chat, share media, and connect with others. The project focuses specifically on capturing and archiving the images exchanged during conversations.

The primary objective of the Discord Image Logger is to provide users with a comprehensive record of all the images shared within a Discord server or channel. This can be useful for various purposes, such as content moderation, documentation, research, or simply preserving memorable moments.

To achieve this, the project may involve the development of a Discord bot or an external application that integrates with Discord's API (Application Programming Interface). The bot or application would monitor the server or channel it is installed in, detect any image uploads, and save them to a secure storage location for future retrieval.

Key features that may be included in the Discord Image Logger project could be:

Image detection: The system should be capable of identifying and distinguishing image files from other types of files shared on Discord.

Automated logging: Once an image is detected, it should be automatically logged and stored in a structured manner to facilitate easy retrieval later on.

Metadata capture: Along with the image file, relevant metadata such as the timestamp, author, server/channel information, and any accompanying text messages could be logged for better context and organization.

Storage and retrieval: The project may involve implementing a secure and scalable storage solution to handle the increasing volume of logged images. It should provide efficient retrieval mechanisms, allowing users to search, filter, and access specific images based on various criteria. User access control: Depending on the project's scope, it might be important to implement appropriate access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized individuals can retrieve or manage the logged images
